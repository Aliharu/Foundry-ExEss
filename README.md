## Credits

This sheet was initially based on the boilerplate system by @asacolips#1867

Code for dot/box counters taken from Foundry-V5 (credit to erizocosmico)

## Notes

Currently the initative tracker rolls Finesse+Athletics with no double 10s.  Reccomended that you don't use foundries built in initiative roller.
